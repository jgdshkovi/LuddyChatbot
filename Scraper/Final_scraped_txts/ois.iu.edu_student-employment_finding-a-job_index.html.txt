job fairs and other career events
at various times during the year.
Classified ads
The
Indiana Daily Student (IDS)
newspaper lists jobs in its classified section. Look for hourly, on-campus jobs (unless you qualify for off-campus employment).
University employers
Potential on-campus employers include:
Residence halls
(cafeterias, center stores, etc.)
Indiana Memorial Union
(many different positions)
Wells Library and school libraries

Academic departments
Many IU departments and offices fill their open positions directly (rather than listing their job opportunities with Career Services). Contact your academic unit and professors for possible job openings.
