Minor in Computer Science
Add computer science to your skill set
Computing powers every part of our world, making computer science skills a valuable addition to any major. In this minor, you’ll learn the fundamentals of computer science and open yourself to a wider range of career possibilities.
The computer science minor is open to students in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering and to students outside the school. If you’re not a Luddy student, you need approval from your school’s recorder.
Turn your minor into a major
All the courses for the minor will count toward the
B.S. in Computer Science
(offered by Luddy) or the
B.A. in Computer Science
(offered by the College of Arts and Sciences).
Review your degree requirements
The minor in computer science was administered by the College of Arts and Sciences before moving to Luddy in November 2018, so requirements for the minor are listed in the College’s undergraduate academic bulletin. To review your specific requirements, choose the bulletin that represents the year you entered IU.
