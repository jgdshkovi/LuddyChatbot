Feast of Epiphany
Description
(i · pi · fuh · nee)
A Christian feast day that celebrates the revelation of God incarnate as Jesus Christ. The feast commemorates the visit of the wise men or noble pilgrims, known as the Magi, who followed a miraculous guiding star to Bethlehem, where they paid homage to the infant Jesus and his baptism in the River Jordan. Eastern traditions, which usually call the holiday Theophany, focus on Jesus' baptism, seen as the manifestation of Christ as both fully human and fully divine. In some countries, Epiphany is as important as Christmas Day, while Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on Epiphany.
Common Practice
Popular Epiphany customs include Epiphany singing, chalking the door, having one's house blessed, consuming Three Kings Cake, winter swimming, and attending church services.
