Animal Computer Informatics Ph.D. Minor
Our Ph.D. minor in Animal-Computer Interaction will supplement the training of students engaged in animal-centered work across a variety of major subject areas, providing an overview of the emerging field of animal-computer interaction as well as training in the technical and project-related skills that support an individual studentâ€™s interests.
The ACI minor touches on five key areas, including maker applications for animals; automated quality of life data capture and analysis for captive animal health and wellness; wildlife (and poacher) tracking and monitoring; animal cognition; and interspecies relationships and education. The Ph.D. minor in animal-computer interaction is 9 credit hours. Two courses are required, and a third must be selected from a list of regularly updated courses.
