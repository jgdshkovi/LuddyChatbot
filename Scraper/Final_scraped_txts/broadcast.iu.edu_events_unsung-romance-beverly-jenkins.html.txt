Unsung Romance: A Conversation with Beverly Jenkins
Thursday, February 13, 2025
“So many people don’t know about the history, and the parts that people of color played in forming this country and building this country. It’s a fascinating study of those who are what I call ‘unsung.’”—Beverly Jenkins
Beverly Jenkins is an NAACP Image Award nominee and bestselling author of over 30 historical and contemporary romance novels. Her historical novels, including Indigo (1996), Topaz (1997), and the Women Who Dare series (2019–2022) center Black characters and Black history often overlooked in the romance genre, in American popular culture, and in history classes. Many of her novels are set in the post-Civil War era, a time in which Black Americans were building their lives, their identities, and legacies for generations to come. Jenkins also writes contemporary romances, including the 2021 romantic suspense novella Rare Danger, featuring a rare book dealer as
heroine
