Cognitive Science Ph.D.
The stand-alone Ph.D. in Cognitive Science gives you the opportunity to focus on a cognitive science content area—such as language, vision, or learning—which is profitably studied from the perspectives of multiple disciplines.
The degree requires a minor that helps you become familiar with one of the disciplines. Beyond that, the larger emphasis is on proficiency in the important methodologies and tools: the relevant mathematics and logic, philosophical investigation, computer modeling, and behavioral research in psychology and neuroscience. You will apply these methodologies to the study of particular problems within your content specialization area.
In this program, you satisfy all of the requirements for a Ph.D. in your originating content area, such as language or reasoning, in order to investigate it from the perspectives of multiple disciplines.
