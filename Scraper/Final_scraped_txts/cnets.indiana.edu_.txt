About
The Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research (CNetS) focuses on fostering interdisciplinary research in all areas related to complex networks and systems, computational social science, and data science. We mine, model, and analyze complex systems and networks, producing high-impact and high-visibility research that applies, and occasionally develops, AI approaches to a wide range of topics: from modeling online diffusion and influence to detecting social bots and online manipulation, and from science of science to climate studies and a range of health-related topics.
