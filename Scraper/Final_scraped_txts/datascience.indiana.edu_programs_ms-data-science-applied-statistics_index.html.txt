Dual M.S. in Data Science and Applied Statistics
Dual M.S. in Data Science and Applied Statistics
Combine statistical science with data science
This dual degree program awards an M.S. in Statistical Science and an M.S. in Data science. It is recommended for students who have a background in statistics and also want to acquire deep computational skills.
You’ll earn two degrees in fewer credit hours and less time than it would take to earn them separately.
Let's stay in touch!
We want to hear from you! The Luddy School is here to answer any questions you may have, and we’re more than happy to guide you down your path to tomorrow.

Program overview
How it works
You need to apply and be admitted by both the data science and statistics admission committees.
Combining the degrees means you can graduate with 52 credit hours, instead of the 61 credit hours it would take to earn the degrees separately.
