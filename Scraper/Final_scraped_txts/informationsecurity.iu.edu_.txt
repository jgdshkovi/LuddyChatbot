What is information security?
Indiana University information security protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of institutional information assets from unauthorized use. IU is committed to providing an environment that protects the security and privacy of institutional information necessary to support its mission and protect its reputation.
This site will educate IU users how to contribute to and cooperate with our protection measures. Here you can educate yourself about:
How to stay safe online
Information & IT policies
The Information Security & Privacy Program
Security resources for IT Staff
How to report unusual behaviors and IT incidents
Together we can keep our campus an open and accessible system.
