Your portfolio should show your best work. An applicant with a software engineering background might submit a system; one with a literature background might submit a critical essay; one with a business background might submit a business plan. Focus on quality, rather than quantity. Portfolios can be submitted only once. No revisions or updates will be allowed. For additional information about the portfolio, visit our
portfolio guidelines page
. Any portfolios that are submitted must follow the portfolio guidelines.
Application and review notification
The admissions committee will review only completed applications. The review process takes several weeks. Decisions should be rendered by mid-March via email.
Deadline for admitted students - April 15
Admitted students will have until April 15 to accept our offer. This is in the spirit of the Council of Graduate School Resolution. If the student has not accepted our offer by April 15, we will withdraw our offer of acceptance.
Financial support
All completed applications reviewed by the admissions review committee are considered for financial awards which the Luddy School may be offering. If you are admitted, the admit letter will detail the financial award, if any. Every year we have limited funds to distribute. The majority of our master’s students receive no funding. Some students find part-time employment to help offset the cost of their education, to gain experience in their field of study, or simply to earn some money. Ph.D. students receive an appointment as an Assistant Instructor or Research Assistant stipend, tuition fee remission, health insurance, and a travel allowance.
University Graduate School fellowship and awards
The University Graduate School offers several internal and external fellowships and awards. The application process and deadlines vary by fellowship and award, so be sure to read the requirements carefully.
International students
Once you are accepted at Indiana University, you will be required to submit documents proving you have the financial means to support yourself for a full calendar year, including tuition, fees, and living expenses.
Your financial documents are not related to your admission decision. However, OIS cannot issue you an immigration document until you have provided sufficient evidence of financial support. We encourage you to submit your financial documents as soon as possible. We will be able to finalize your application and process your necessary immigration documents sooner.
Although proof of funding is required for only the first year, you are expected to fund your studies for the duration of your program. When adding up your expenses, remember that you should not look to employment as a means of support. Not only do you need authorization before you can start a job, but you are also limited in the number of hours you can work.
English proficiency:
Review our requirements for IELTS, TOEFFL, or Duolingo in our
supporting materials
section.
Three year degrees:
We require at least five semesters of grades for 3-year degree. For the 4-year degree, we require at least six semesters of grades.
