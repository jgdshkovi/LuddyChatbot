Cybersecurity for the  Extraordinary
Our mission is to provide people with the knowledge and skills they need to manage cybersecurity risks in complex, challenging environments where standard cybersecurity practices do not suffice. We do so through a combination of thought leadership, applied research, training and education, operational services, and extensive interdisciplinary collaboration. With a multidisciplinary approach, the
Center for Applied Cybersecurity (CACR)
specializes in helping communities and organizations with
practical
cybersecurity.
