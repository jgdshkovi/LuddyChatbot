Explore financial aid options for international students
Gathering resources to fund your education in the United States can be one of the most challenging parts of the admissions process. Financial help is available, but finding it takes work and persistence.
Start by researching funding possibilities in your home country. Contact an
overseas advising center
to learn about opportunities.
Scholarships
Scholarships are competitive awards that do not require repayment or a work commitment—they should be your first choice when looking for financial aid.
Student loans
As an international student, you are not eligible for student loans through the U.S. federal government. You still have options for borrowing money for school, though.
Sponsored funding
If a government, company, or organization is paying for your studies at IU, you’re considered to be a sponsored student.
External funding
There are numerous opportunities for external funding, so it is worthwhile to expand your scholarship search beyond IU. Be patient—most scholarships are available only to U.S. citizens.
Fellowships and assistantships
If you are a graduate student, you may be able to secure a fellowship or assistantship through your department.
An assistantship is a paid position that requires you to teach or conduct research. A fellowship is an award of money that may or may not come with a work requirement.
Contact your school or department for details.
