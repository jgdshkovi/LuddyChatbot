Data science career paths
What is a master’s in data science?
A master's in
data science
is an advanced degree that bridges mathematics, statistics, and
computer science
. This program equips students with skills in computer
programming languages
, applied statistics, database systems, and machine learning. Whether pursued online or in-person, these programs offer identical curricula taught by the same faculty, preparing graduates for diverse tech roles.
Data science curriculum and skills taught
Data science master's programs offer a comprehensive curriculum that blends statistical and computational methods. The coursework emphasizes real-world applications while adopting a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates elements from statistics, computer science, and law. Beyond technical skills, students develop crucial soft skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication, with a particular focus on data ethics.
Core coursework at many data science programs covers the following topics:
Cloud computing
Data engineering
Data mining
Data visualization
Information ethics
Machine learning
Research design
Statistical analysis
Students gain proficiency in software like Alteryz, Databricks, and Power BI, along with programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL.
Data science project-based learning
Project-based learning is a cornerstone of top data science programs, providing students with hands-on experience in real-world scenarios. Many programs culminate in a capstone or thesis project tailored to students' interests, with over half of the programs in Fortune's ranking including this requirement.
Data science specializations and concentrations
Concentrations allow students to carve out a niche within the field, enhancing their expertise in specific areas of data science. Each university has unique offerings. Be sure to do your research, as some institutions label them differently or may simply offer many electives that catch your attention. Some examples of concentration offerings include:
Fundamentals of data science, data acquisition and management, data security, or business applications (Stevens Institute of Technology)
Artificial intelligence, big data, data & business analytics, data pipelines & platforms, language analytics, project management, or visual analytics (Syracuse University)
Marketing analytics, advanced data science, health analytics, or
cybersecurity
analytics (Oklahoma State University)
Admissions information for master’s in data science
While requirements may vary between institutions, most data science graduate programs typically expect:
A bachelor's degree from an accredited institution
Relevant work or educational experience in data-related fields
A personal statement or essay
Letters of recommendation
Standardized test scores (
GRE or GMAT
), if requested
A data proficiency examination (in some cases)
Many programs have eliminated mandatory GRE scores, shifting focus to other application components, though some may still accept standardized test scores. The average acceptance rate for schools in Fortune's ranking is approximately 42%
GMAT, GRE, and GPA requirements for master’s in data science
Many master’s programs in data science have removed GRE or GMAT score requirements. Applicants may still submit these scores if they believe it strengthens their application. GPA requirements vary by institution, and some programs may waive them for applicants with substantial professional experience. While test score requirements have been relaxed, the admissions process remains competitive. Programs place greater emphasis on other aspects of the application, making it crucial to present a well-rounded and compelling profile.
Which factors drive acceptance into a master's in data science program?
Admissions teams often take a holistic approach when reviewing applications, focusing on:
Educational background:
A strong foundation in data-related fields or quantitative coursework is often preferred.
Professional experience:
Work in data-centric roles can set applicants apart.
Personal essays:
A clear articulation of goals and reasons for choosing the program is highly valued.
How to choose the best master’s degree program in data science for you: Factors to consider beyond rankings
When selecting a program, you should consider a variety of factors alongside their ranking:
Cost and financial aid:
Tuition ranges from under $40,000 to over $80,000, depending on the school.
Prestige and curriculum:
School reputation and course offerings can impact career prospects.
Program flexibility:
Look at start dates, program length, and scheduling options.
Learning opportunities:
Project-based courses and concentrations can enhance skills and employability.
Networking:
Alumni networks and industry connections play a significant role in career advancement.
Start times, schedule, and program length
Many programs offer multiple start dates throughout the year, allowing students to align their education with personal and professional schedules. While most programs take around two years to complete, accelerated and extended options are available, providing flexibility to accommodate diverse timelines.
Project-based learning
Hands-on projects are common in master’s in data science, allowing students to build portfolios that demonstrate practical skills. These opportunities are especially beneficial for career changers as they provide tangible evidence of your skills—something that can be especially resourceful when applying for jobs.
Concentrations
Concentrations within data science programs allow students to tailor their education to career goals and help graduates land roles that may be outside of the traditional data scientist role. Specializations can lead to higher salaries, with roles like data scientist earning up to $170,000 annually and managerial positions exceeding $250,000.
Cost
Tuition for online master’s in data science programs varies widely. Some affordable programs cost less than $40,000, including those at the University of Delaware, University of North Texas, Clarkson University, and Texas Tech University. Conversely, elite institutions like New York University, Harvard University (Paulson), and Johns Hopkins University (Whiting) charge over $80,000 for their programs.
Financial aid opportunities, such as scholarships, assistantships, and employer reimbursement programs, can help offset costs. It's essential to research and apply for available funding to make your degree more affordable.
Network and access to alumni
The size and strength of a program’s alumni network can have a lasting impact on your career. Schools with robust alumni networks often provide mentorship opportunities, industry connections, and job leads. Even online programs foster networking through virtual events and collaborative coursework, making it easier to build meaningful professional relationships.
Careers for master’s in data science graduates
Data science graduates are in high demand across industries, including tech, healthcare, entertainment, and finance. While major employers like Microsoft, IBM, and Meta offer lucrative salaries and benefits, opportunities extend beyond tech giants. Fields like sports analytics, consulting, and pharmaceuticals also rely heavily on data science expertise.
Graduates often receive multiple job offers, with starting salaries exceeding $100,000. According to Glassdoor, mid-level data scientists can earn up to $164,000 annually, while senior roles may command over $200,000 or even $300,000 at top companies.
Financing and scholarships
Several organizations offer financial aid to data science students:
Association of Computing Machinery (ACM):
