About these numbers
We’re showing you the estimated cost of attendance for the full 2025–2026 academic year (fall and spring semesters). Cut these numbers in half to figure out the cost of a single semester.
To get the most benefits from each academic year, students will be able to take advantage of 40 credit hours across fall, spring, and our August and winter intersessions—for the same cost.
Tuition and fees outlined here for the 2025–2026 academic year are based on 40 credit hours across all terms for undergraduates and 11 credits per semester for graduate students.
Your actual costs for housing and food, books and supplies, transportation, and personal expenses will vary based on:
The number of credit hours you take
Whether you’re an Indiana resident
Your personal choices
Your travel habits
Your cost of attendance may differ from these estimates. For your specific budget, visit the Financial Aid Summary page under Financials in your
Student Center.
