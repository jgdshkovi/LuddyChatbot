Hudson & Holland is committed to our scholars’ academic success and our students' social, emotional, and mental well-being. Our office provides a variety of support services to address the holistic needs of our scholars throughout their tenure at IU. Hudson & Holland Scholars are some of the most scholastically successful students at IU, and their presence and contributions deeply enrich the campus learning environment.
HHSP Scholarship
Every HHSP student pursuing a bachelor’s degree at IU receives the HHSP Scholarship, which is allocated on a yearly basis for up to four years (or eight consecutive semesters). The HHSP award is renewed every academic year if the student maintains a 3.00 GPA.
Students are eligible for eight consecutive semesters of the HHSP award. This implies that students who pause their studies at IU may lose eligibility for the HHSP scholarship. Students who withdraw or transfer from IU for no more than two semesters may request reinstatement into HHSP. Other circumstances may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

These basic requirements must be met to maintain funding and receive standard cords at graduation. In alignment with our reimagined mission, Hudson & Holland aims to enhance inclusive excellence at Indiana University through the recruitment, support, and holistic development of high-achieving students from underrepresented groups; beginning in fall 2024, Hudson & Holland Scholars will be able to work toward graduating with one of the following distinctions: Cream, Crimson, Gold, or Platinum. Incoming first-year students who enroll in a Hudson & Holland Intensive First-Year Seminar will automatically receive Cream scholar status. Cream Scholars will receive the standard HHSP cord, an additional cream-colored cord upon graduation, and a certificate of achievement. Criteria for each distinction level will be released in the fall of 2024 to all Hudson & Holland enrolled scholars.
Incoming students NOT directly admitted into the Kelley School of Business must participate in the Kelley Prep Academy. Kelley Prep Academy (KPA) is a one-year program in the Kelley Undergraduate of Access and Community Enhancement (KACE) created for students applying to Kelley through the Standard Admissions Process (also known as Pre-Kelley majors). The program includes professional and academic development events, social events, study tables/tutors for rigorous first-year courses, an academic pledge of excellence, admissions, and academic guidance from Kelley Admissions staff with opportunities to interact with Kelley faculty outside the classroom. This requirement only applies to active Pre-Kelley majors. Should a student change their major during KPA, they will be exempt from this requirement. Students directly admitted into Kelley are exempt from this requirement.
Partnership Funding Opportunities
Hudson & Holland scholars with certain majors may be eligible for additional funding from their degree-granting schools. Below is a list of partnering IU schools and scholarship amounts. Please note, only scholars who are in “good standing” with Hudson & Holland by maintaining the requisite cumulative 3.00 GPA and have met certification requirements or are a direct admit into their program are eligible for these partnership scholarships. Other applications, deadlines, and award renewal requirements may apply.
