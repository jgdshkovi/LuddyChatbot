Funding for graduate school
The commitment to graduate school is a significant investment in your future. We understand that the costs associated with several years of dedicated study are not insignificant.
Full-time graduate students in our program are supported by teaching assistantships, research assistantships, or fellowships from within the Cognitive Science Program or (for students in the joint Ph.D. program) from within other departments.
Some students receive fellowships from the Graduate School or are accepted to receive Training Grant fellowships. Others receive research assistantships from external grants.
Support for summer is also available from a variety of sources, including Cognitive Science summer fellowships, awarded on a competitive basis.
