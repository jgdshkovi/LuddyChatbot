In 2022, the Hamilton Lugar School was awarded $16.3M from the Department of Education's prestigious Title VI program
â€” more than any other university nationwide.
What is Title VI?
Title VI centers are essential to the development of American expertise in critical languages and cultures, as well as to fostering international education. In awarding the grants, the Department of Education designated six HLS programs as National Resource Centers:
African Studies Program
Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies
Center for the Study of Global Change
Center for the Study of the Middle East
Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center
Robert F. Byrnes Russian and East European Institute
The Hamilton Lugar School Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region and the National African Language Resource Center also received four-year funding through Title VI as National Language Resource Centers. In addition, the Islamic Studies Program, the Institute for European Studies, and the six National Resource Centers received Foreign Language and Area Studies awards.
