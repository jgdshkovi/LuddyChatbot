Health insurance at IU
In the United States, health insurance is necessary to receive medical care at a more affordable rate. As an international student or scholar, you are required to have it for your entire stay in the U.S. Having adequate health insurance ensures that you comply with visitor regulations, stay healthy, and protect yourself from unexpected medical costs.
IU will enroll students in its health insurance plan. Scholars can choose to purchase the same insurance or select another company as long as it meets certain requirements.
Your insurance responsibilities and options
Medical care at IU
There are many qualified doctors and health care providers in Bloomington and the surrounding area. We recommend you go to the IU Student Health Center, but you do have options to receive care for routine treatments, unexpected illnesses, and severe emergencies.
