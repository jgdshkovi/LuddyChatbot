Serve IT
Serve IT’s mission is to apply the technology skills of undergraduate students in order to build capacity in the local nonprofit community to better serve their own missions.
The
Serve IT Nonprofit Clinic
is housed in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, and is a joint project with the Kelley School of Business and the O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University Bloomington.
We provide internship credits to students who want to work together to use their skills to make our local community a better place.
Teach IT
Teach IT’s mission is to develop the professional skills of undergraduate students by supporting the technological self-efficacy of community members, young and old.
Teach IT works with agencies that provide education experiences such as the Boys & Girls Clubs, local schools, the Monroe County Public Library, and Meadowood Retirement Community.
Student interns in Teach IT do their work in the community, supporting kids, teens, and adults learn everyday tech skills.
