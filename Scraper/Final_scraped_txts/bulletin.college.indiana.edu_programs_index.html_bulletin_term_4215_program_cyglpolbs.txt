Cybersecurity and Global Policy Program
Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity and Global
Policy
Students on Summer 2021, Fall 2021, or Spring 2022 requirements
CYGLPOLBS
The B.S. provides students with both technical and policy expertise in a rapidly expanding field, one in which there is high demand for skilled professionals. Through pursuing this degree, students will gain a sophisticated understanding of programming, data structures, networked systems, and security protocols. They will also learn about the wide range of privacy, cultural, economic, legal, and security issues surrounding the field of cybersecurity. They will learn to assess risk, explore possible responses to cyber attacks, and examine how cybersecurity crosses national boundaries and thereby challenges traditional, state-oriented understandings and responses. Upon graduation, students should be able to work closely and communicate effectively with a wide range of both technical and policy experts in the public, nonprofit, and private realms.

This class covers the fundamentals of computer security by looking at how things can go wrong, and how people can abuse the system. This is a matter of creative cheating; to find loopholes and exploit them. After students learn how to attack the system, it is possible to propose ways to make the system secure. Students will gain a basic overview of existing security problems and be exposed to methods that can be used to secure against such problems. The course should be taken by any one designing, selecting, or using applications in which security or privacy plays a role.
