Formalizing your collaborations
If you’re IU faculty or staff, work with your school’s designated
international administrator
to propose agreements to formally recognize a partnership or to initiate specific activities with a partner.
Partnerships with universities, research centers and institutes, governmental agencies, NGOs, and other organizations should involve active collaboration on international activities. The
types of collaboration
can take many forms—collaborative research and teaching, joint workshops and conferences, student and faculty exchanges, dual degree programs, and even overseas offices.
Want to know if IU already collaborates with a partner? Before you propose an agreement, check the
registry of active agreements
.
Prepare a proposal
Our
international partnerships staff
can help guide you through the proposal process, from the preparation of the application through the execution of the agreement. Before you begin, be sure to review the policies and guidelines, templates, and application.
Read the policies and guidelines
All agreements that establish an affiliation or partnership with a foreign entity, as well as any international activities conducted under an agreement, must undergo a rigorous review and approval process.
Download a template
These templates are a starting point that reflect the standard terms that are typically required in agreements for specific types of international activities.
Complete an application
IU faculty and staff should complete an online application to propose an agreement. The review and approval process will begin when the application is submitted.
