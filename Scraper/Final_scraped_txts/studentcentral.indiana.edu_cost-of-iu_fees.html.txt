Learn about fees at IU
When you register, you’re agreeing to pay the fees associated with your education. There are several categories of fees that may apply to you. Some IU offices also allow you to charge the costs for their services or products to your student account. If you charge these to your student account, you're billed just as you are for tuition and other fees.
Did you know?
Indiana University recently restructured fees to help students and their families better anticipate and budget. Students are no longer charged late schedule change fees, late registration fees, transcript fees, or special credit fees.
