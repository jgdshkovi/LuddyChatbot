Cybersecurity research opportunities for ROTC cadets
The Cyber ROTC program is designed to grow a capable and trained military workforce with the skills to defend against emergent cyber and electronic warfare threats. ROTC cadets are paired with faculty researchers from the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering; Ostrom Workshop’s Program on Cybersecurity and Internet Governance; Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research; and the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies, and will pursue research topics in cybersecurity fields.
Funding from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) supports 10 student participants in active research. Each student participant is funded to work closely with a faculty supervisor and a graduate mentor for a full academic year. Students and faculty will also work collaboratively with the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN) and its extensive portfolio of programs for national service. The proposed program’s partnership with NSIN will connect student participants to Navy and Marine Corps careers, content, facilities, and personnel.
