Third-party sponsors
Sponsored students are those for whom an agency outside the university is paying student fees and requires an invoice submitted directly from the university. This usually is an employer but includes government agencies, vocational rehabilitation, military branches, or foreign governments.
To become a sponsor at Indiana University, you must be able to enroll in and utilize our vended sponsor portal. This portal will be used to obtain invoices, submit payments, and ensure enhanced security for our sponsors through email authentication.
How does it work?
To initiate the process, you (or the organization sponsoring you) must submit a financial voucher or other documentation from the sponsoring agency indicating what portion of your tuition and fees should be billed to the sponsoring agency. The financial voucher may be called an authorization, letter of credit, or financial guarantee. The financial voucher or other documentation should include, at a minimum, the following information:
Your name and university identification number (UID)
Authorized term or range of dates covered by the financial voucher
Sponsor organization’s contact information, including name, mailing address, and phone number
Amount authorized or the kinds of charges covered by the financial voucher
Submitting sponsor information
Vouchers may be submitted using
One.IU
.
To avoid late fees, vouchers should be submitted using One.IU before the due date listed on your bill. Vouchers submitted after the fourth full week of a term may be declined.
Payment of fees by the sponsor cannot be contingent on final grades, course completion, or employment status.
Questions from Sponsors can be emailed to
iuspon@iu.edu
. Student questions should be directed to
Student Central
.
Canceling sponsor credits
Due to the nature of the sponsor process, most sponsor credit adjustments or cancellations happen late in the semester, after the Office of the Bursar has exhausted all efforts to collect payment. It is important for sponsored students to monitor their university email as that is the official means of communication for the university. A credit on your student account does not mean the sponsor has fulfilled their obligation.
Failure on the part of the sponsor to pay could result in a past due balance subject to late fees.
Within 48 hours of receipt of the voucher, the Office of the Bursar will place a credit on your student account, which will defer your fee payment obligation and keep your account in good standing. The appropriate charges are transferred to the sponsor’s account and invoiced after the term’s refund periods are over. The invoice is due in full approximately 30 days later.
If the invoice becomes past due, the Office of the Bursar will continue to follow up with the sponsor to determine why there is a delay in payment. If the payment is not received or the sponsor does not respond, you will be notified via email. For your student account to remain in good standing, the sponsor must pay or contact us within 14 days. At this point, you should follow up with your sponsor to determine why the sponsor has not paid. In most cases, the sponsor needs additional information from you.
