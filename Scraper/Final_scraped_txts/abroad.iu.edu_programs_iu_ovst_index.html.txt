Education Abroad provides a wide range of study abroad opportunities from year-long language & cultural immersion programs to short-term thematic programs. Our programs fall within two types: IU-Administered and Co-Sponsored (programs administered by an organization or institution with which IU partners). See the chart below for important distinctions between these two program types.
The application cycle for spring Education Abroad programs will open in early July.
