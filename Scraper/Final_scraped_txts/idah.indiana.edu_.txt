A June 2024 Message from the Directors
On July 1, 2024, digital arts and humanities support will merge into the Institute for Advanced Studies (IAS).
While our colleagues at IAS plan for this transition, many of
IDAH's programs will be suspended until funding and staffing is finalized. For those of you in the graduate DAH Minor/Certificate program, we will have news on that program's new home later in the summer.
We are updating content here to reflect IDAH's new manifestation as an
Initiative for Digital Arts & Humanities
, including workshop-on-demand resources produced in previous years that we hope can help you during this transition.
Thank you for your steadfast support over these years — for sharing your excitement for digital arts and humanities research and creative pursuits, for learning alongside us as we experimented with digital methods and charted the unknown, for collaborating with us as we took projects to the next level (or half-level), and for your grace and generosity and collaborative generosity.
DIGITAL A&H TRAINING ON DEMAND
RESOURCES + TEACHING TEMPLATES
Our graduate assistants and staff have created a small selection of digital methods guides for novice practitioners, providing a gentle introduction to mapping, network analysis, and more. In addition, we have a series of teaching templates intended to help guide instructors and professors through using digital methods in their own classrooms.
RECORDED WORKSHOPS + LECTURES
Our digital methods workshops demonstrate how applications of mapping, data mining, network analysis, data visualization, 3D rendering, and other digital methods can help arts and humanities practitioners craft new research questions and answer those questions. We also link attendees to the IU resources that can support these efforts, and provide practical examples of these digital-methods applications in a variety of environments.
