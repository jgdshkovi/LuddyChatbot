The
Grant Thornton Institute for Data Exploration for Risk Assessment and Management (GT-IDEA)
is an interdisciplinary institute that spans IU’s Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, Kelley School of Business, and School of Public and Environmental Affairs.
Thanks to Grant Thornton’s generosity, students from the participating schools will have the opportunity to work together to solve problems, explore data-driven approaches to risk assessment, and devise new solutions to better manage risk in the age of artificial intelligence. Their work, as well as the research of GT-Scholars is expected to lead to the creation of better services to navigate strategic challenges, and meet governance demands and compliance obligations. The multidisciplinary nature of this institute and the synergies that it will create are the key factors in meetings the policy, technological, and business needs of today's society.
GT-IDEA@Luddy will include a data jam session that focuses on data-driven risk assessment and management, as well as a forum on automation for risk assessment and management.
