Overview
Some F-1 students are eligible for practical training. There are two types of F-1 practical training: curricular practical training (CPT) and optional practical training (OPT).
Type of Practical Training
Distinction
Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
Training relates directly to the student’s major area of study.
Training is an integral part of the school’s established curriculum.
Designated school official (DSO) authorized CPT in SEVIS, and the authorization prints on the student’s Form I-20.
Occurs
before
the student’s program end date on the Form I-20.
Authorization is for one specific employer and for a specific period of time.
Student must secure the training opportunity before CPT can be authorized.
CPT must be authorized before the student can begin work.
Student can have more than one CPT authorization at the same time.
One year of full-time CPT eliminates a student’s eligibility for OPT.
Optional Practical Training (OPT)
Training relates directly to the student’s major area of study.
DSO recommends OPT in SEVIS.
Student does not have to secure training before the DSO can recommend OPT.
Authorized by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), and the student is issued an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).
Allows the student to work for any employer, as long as the training relates to the student’s major course of study
Can occur
before
or
after
the student’s program end date.
Periods of OPT cannot overlap.
Students are eligible for an additional 12 months of OPT authorization, when they change to a higher educational level.
This article focuses on CPT.

Regulations and Policy
Complex rules apply to CPT because the training opportunity must comply with both:
Federal regulations
School policies regarding internships, experiential learning, etc.
Designated school officials must understand the following federal regulations and policy guidance to determine if a student qualifies for CPT:
Regulations applicable to CPT:
8 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 214.2(f)(10)
and (f)(10(i)

Eligibility
A DSO can authorize CPT for an F-1 student enrolled at an SEVP-certified college, university, conservatory, or seminary if the student:
Has been lawfully enrolled on a full-time basis for at least a full academic year.
Note:
An exception exists for students in graduate studies whose programs require earlier training.
Is not studying English as a second language.
Has secured a training position.
CPT authorization is only required when the training is inside the United States. For example, a summer internship in a student’s home country does not need CPT authorization.
