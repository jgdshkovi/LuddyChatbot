Non-IU Programs
Within specific parameters, Indiana University allows students to pursue non-IU programs abroad that are based in locations (cities) where IU does not already have a program among its approved offerings*. Students may only apply for a program using the non-IU procedures process if they wish to study in a location where IU (either via the central Education Abroad office or their College/School) does not currently offer an approved program*. A non-IU program is defined as a program that is not managed through an IU office and yields transfer credit. Examples include:
an independent study abroad provider program
another U.S. institution's program
directly enrolling at an institution abroad
*Excludes Flagship language summer programs.
