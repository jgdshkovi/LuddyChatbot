The External Experiential Programs (EEPs) initiative is designed to connect students with valuable opportunities that support their academic pursuits and career aspirations. In collaboration with the Career Services Team, these programs will be sourced and posted, ensuring a direct correlation with the curriculum, and providing students with hands-on experiences that enhance their learning. To maintain a high standard, companies that are offering these opportunities will undergo a vetting process facilitated by Career Services, guaranteeing that students are presented with reputable and enriching experiences.
Ultimately, this dedicated page is a dynamic resource tailored for students, providing them with a comprehensive catalog of opportunities to explore and engage in experiences that align with their academic and professional goals.
