Polish Jewish Culture beyond the Capital: Centering the Periphery
is a path-breaking exploration of the diversity and vitality of urban Jewish identity and culture in Polish lands from the second half of the nineteenth century to the outbreak of the Second World War (1899–1939). In this multidisciplinary essay collection, a cohort of international scholars provides an integrated history of the arts and humanities in Poland by illuminating the complex roles Jews in urban centers other than Warsaw played in the creation of Polish and Polish Jewish culture.
Each essay presents readers with the extraordinary production and consumption of culture by Polish Jews in literature, film, cabaret, theater, the visual arts, architecture, and music. They show how this process was defined by a reciprocal cultural exchange that flourished between cities at the periphery—from Lwów and Wilno to Kraków and Łódź—and international centers like Warsaw, thereby illuminating the place of Polish Jews within urban European cultures.

“This splendid collection of essays breaks new ground in the study of Polish Jews and their cultural engagements. They redraw the map, bring centers and peripheries into unexpected relations, delineate cultural spaces in novel ways, and treat topics never before considered with a bracing freshness.”
~Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Ronald S. Lauder Chief Curator, Core Exhibition, POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews
"Polish Jewish life and culture has always been regional, diversely reflected in a multitude of centers from shtetlekh to urban working-class districts to provincial capitals. In this fascinating volume, leading scholars of Polish Jewry present original essays on the varieties of Jewish culture that once flourished in and around Poland."
~Jeffrey Veidlinger, author of In the Midst of Civilized Europe: The 1918–1921 Pogroms in Ukraine and the Onset of the Holocaust
