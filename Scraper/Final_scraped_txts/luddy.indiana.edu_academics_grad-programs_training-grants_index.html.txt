Interdisciplinary training in complex networks and systems
The National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) program encourages the development of bold, potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. There is a growing need to train Ph.D. students to be bi-disciplinary in Complex Networks and Systems (CNS) as well as another discipline of their choosing from the natural and social sciences.
The CNS NRT program is a Ph.D. program that seamlessly integrates project-driven, team-based research with academic education to teach trainees to connect the general purpose computational expertise of CNS to the deep, domain-specific research methodologies of the natural, behavioral and social sciences. The program creates a new breed of STEM scientists that will escape the silos of disciplinary training to address the complex problems of the 21st century.
The program provides an opportunity to bridge the gap between training cultures to develop a more progressive way of problem solving by combining expertise from various disciplines while building on the strengths and breadth of the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.
