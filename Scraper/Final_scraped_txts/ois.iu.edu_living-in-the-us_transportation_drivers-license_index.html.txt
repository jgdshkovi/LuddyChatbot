Obtaining an Indiana driver’s license
Strictly speaking, you can drive in Indiana with your driver’s permit from home.  However, to minimize inconvenience, it would be best to obtain an Indiana driver’s license if:
You do not have a driver’s license from your home country.
You have been, or plan to be, in the United States for more than one year.
In any case, you should learn the laws of the road and the requirements of driving a vehicle in the U.S. If you get stopped by the police or are involved in an accident,
IU Student Legal Services
may be able to help you.
If you do not have a driver’s license in your home country
If you
do not
have a driver’s license in your home country, the first step to getting an Indiana driver’s license is to obtain a learner’s permit.
A learner’s permit allows you to practice driving under the supervision of a licensed driver so that you can learn the rules of the road well enough to pass the tests required to obtain your driver’s license.
The Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) has more information about
getting and using a learner’s permit
.
A learner’s permit can expire
Your learner’s permit will have an expiration date on it. You have until that date to obtain a permanent driver’s license. If you let the permit expire, you will have to start the process over from the beginning.
How to get an Indiana driver’s license
When you are ready to apply for your permanent driver’s license, you will need to go to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) to take a driving test, written knowledge test, and vision test. You will also need to supply the required documents.
You must make an appointment for the driving test, and you must bring a car to drive for the test. The BMV website explains how to make an appointment and what documents to bring.

Renewing an Indiana license
Your license is typically good for six years (or until the end of your stay, whichever is earlier), so many individuals will not need to renew their license.
However, if you do need to, you can only renew it within 30 days of its expiration.
