About Us
At the Proactive Health Informatics research group (ProHealth), we study how technology can empower people to understand, manage, and improve their health.
Our research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Health Informatics, and UX and UI design, but can also include adjacent domains such as Psychology, Data Science, and Gender Studies.
Our work spans a variety of approaches and epistimologies. Whether it's interviewing a target population on their lived health experiences, co-designing a supportive technology with key stakeholders, or developing and deploying a health support system in the wild, we're interested in learning the many different ways technology can have a positive impact on people's everyday health and wellbeing.
Interested in working with us? We actively recruit motivated PhD students and postdoctoral collaborators. If you are in either of those categories, reach out to the faculty you share research interests with. We are also open to working with BS and MS students. If you are in this category, take a class taught by one of our faculty or inquire about independent study opportunities.
