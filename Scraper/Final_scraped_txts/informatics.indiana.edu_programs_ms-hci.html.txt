M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction
M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction
Address complex issues with a human-centered and socially responsible perspective
Let's stay in touch!
Our Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction Design (HCI/d) is a unique graduate experience that creates professionals who will shape the future of human-centered design. This intensive two-year program enables you to shape interactive experiences, services, and systems in ways that:
Positively impact the user experience (UX)
Serve the need of diverse stakeholders
Facilitate communication and collaboration
Enrich the lives of the people and communities using them
You will complete a combination of required studio courses, which allow you to interact in a hands-on, collaborative learning environment. You will also choose elective courses to round out your own areas of specialization as an HCI/d professional.
This program is classified as a STEM program.
Areas of program focus
All students will build skills in interaction design, design strategy, and user research methods as part of the core studio courses at the heart of the HCI/d program. Beyond this core, students select electives to further differentiate themselves in ways that inform their unique design perspective.
Common ways students make the program their own include:
Connecting different forms of domain or technical knowledge to their HCI/d knowledge (e.g., connecting perspectives from data science, visualization, AI, education, public policy, or other fields)
Leveraging unique disciplinary perspectives (e.g., using your undergraduate degree in architecture, engineering, or virtually any other field to enrich your HCI-focused perspective)
Preparing for specific industry sectors (e.g., working in a Fortune 500 or 100 company, at an agile startup, or considering working in organizations with higher or lower UX maturity)
Identifying specific types of job role specialization (e.g., jobs that focus more on the design of user interfaces, user research, product management, or generalist positions)
What can you do with this degree after graduation?
Our alumni go on to work in a wide range of industries and job roles all over the world. As UX- and HCI-related job roles have evolved, we continue to prepare students to effectively adapt to the changing strategic and technology landscape and become leaders. Our graduates take a broad range of job roles, including: UX designer, UX researcher, product manager, UX engineer, and more. Many of our alumni have also contributed to creating cultures of UX majority in their respective organizations, taking on design leadership positions and impacting the future of the profession.

Description of the video:
00:00 being in the cohort and the culture of
00:02 the cohort is a lot like having a family
00:05 that you don't really know that well at
00:08 first and you're getting to know God
00:15 means like unity and family thing
00:19 feeling of that oh man I like a lot of
00:23 that's called cohort I like sorry I know
00:25 that's weird but like cohort like it's
00:28 just the connotations with it are kind
00:31 of really true like I kind of thought
00:32 cohort as a class at first like Oh class
00:35 of 2019 which here at IU that's what
00:38 10,000 people that's not really family
00:40 whereas here a cohort like the
00:42 connotations I've learned with the art
00:44 of more like family and friends and
00:46 people I can really depend on I have
00:49 never been happy in such close
00:53 relationship with a cohort before in my
00:56 undergraduate so
00:58 like we would
01:01 have tea meeting its
01:06 not not only about the project but also
01:10 about our lives before and what we
01:13 wanted to do in the future a ton of
01:15 people who are all completely different
01:17 but everybody's on the same page because
01:20 everyone's here for the same reasons we
01:22 go to a lot of events together we will
01:26 invite childr to our places so we really
01:31 have a great connection with each other
01:34 I know everyone's name I know everyone's
01:36 first and last name I another face it's
01:37 like it's cool like we're we are a big
01:40 family and we care about each other
01:43 that makes me feel really good and I've
01:47 never been friend befriended so many
01:50 people so fast and had such an
01:53 instantaneous deep-rooted connection and
01:56 it's not just like surface level it's
02:00 like much deeper
Description of the video:
00:01 you get up in the morning and you're
00:03 like oh let's see what's gonna be today
00:05 like what special thing is gonna happen
00:08 what new experience I'm gonna go through
00:11 or what am I gonna learn today
00:13 everything you are interested is
00:16 available for you being a part of this
00:19 program that see a family is a great
00:22 thing to have I feel happy every day
00:28 to be honest before the say mister
00:31 started I kind of still doubt doubt it
00:35 like if this program is the right choice
00:38 for me that after the first lecture
00:42 after all this I think this is the most
00:47 right decision I've ever made in my life
00:51 in some ways it feels like a family like
00:54 we're very tight-knit we do a lot of
00:58 things together every professor is so
01:00 friendly you can go out with them for
01:02 dinner for a coffee and like see there
01:06 are no concept of senior junior they all
01:08 are friends they all are family everyone
01:11 give you gifts your time we have a lot
01:13 of activities to know each other so
01:17 before the school starts before we start
01:19 the real projects we already like have
01:23 like know each other for a long time so
01:26 that's how we can collaborate with each
01:28 other like very well because undergrad
01:31 I'm taking some courses because I have
01:33 to take the course whereas here I'm
01:35 genuinely interested in every course
01:37 I've taken even if you may not see the
01:40 benefit initially you will not believe
01:42 how much you think about and talk about
01:44 design after taking just a few weeks of
01:46 a course I feel that I'm living I'm
01:49 doing something I'm learning something
01:50 they'd given if you were sitting in the
01:52 studio not probably doing anything just
01:55 reflecting upon how your day was or what
01:58 you learned or even listen to some
02:00 people talking you're actually gathering
02:02 a lot of knowledge learning a lot I mean
02:06 I feel like this program really like
02:09 helped me to be the person I wanted to
02:13 be helping me to be myself I think you
02:16 can sum it up by saying like I'm finally
02:18 learning for myself rather than a chore
02:21 being put on me like just to get a
02:24 degree rather learning to like actually
02:26 learn and that's what like so it's just
02:29 very satisfying
02:31 for you
