Paying taxes in the United States
Many international scholars, workers, and students have to file a tax report (called a tax return) with the federal government each year. It is important to understand what you must do to protect your immigration status.
You will likely need to file a state tax return as well, after you have filed your federal return.
I didn't make any money, do I still have to file?
Even if you do not have income, most international students and scholars need to file
Form 8843
each year to comply with immigration laws.
IU International Tax Questionnaire
If you are an international scholar, worker, or student at IU, you need to submit the IU International Tax Questionnaire. You need to submit this form every year to the Office of the University Controller to determine your tax residency status and to determine any eligible tax treaty benefits you might be able to receive.
Access the form
If you have questions about the form, please contact the
Office of the University Controller.
