Meet our primary international partners
Indiana University has established primary, university-level partnerships with approximately 40 international institutions. While the majority of these institutions rank among the best in the world or within their region or country, all partners, regardless of their ranking, offer valuable opportunities to advance IU's academic mission and international priorities.
Academic programs and offices across the IU system pursue various types of cooperative activities with these partners—dual degrees and certificates, exchange programs, joint workshops and conferences, collaborative research and teaching, and more.
