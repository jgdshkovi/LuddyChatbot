Philosophy M.A. degree
Only students who are already enrolled in a graduate degree program at Indiana University Bloomington, including students in the Philosophy Ph.D. program, may earn a Philosophy M.A. degree from our department. Interested students who satisfy this condition should contact our Director of Graduate Studies.
Requirements for the Philosophy M.A.
A total of 30 credit hours, at least 20 credit hours of which must be in courses given in the Philosophy department. These must include at least one course in each of four subject areas: history of philosophy, metaphysÂ­ics and epistemology, logic, and value theory. Course P590 may not be used to satisfy the distribution requirement. No more than six hours in P590 may count toward the 20 hours required in Philosophy. Courses P804 and P805 do not count toward the credit hours required in Philosophy. A minimum grade of B (3.0) is required in each course that counts toward the degree.
