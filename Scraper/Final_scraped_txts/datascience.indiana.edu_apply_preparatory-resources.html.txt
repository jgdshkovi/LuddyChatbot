Sufficient mathematical and programming skills are essential to any budding data scientist, analyst, consultant, or engineer. If you have no experience with programming or need a refresher in topics such as calculus or linear algebra, self-study could be a benefit prior to applying.
Fortunately, several low-cost certification options are available through open-source courses such as
Coursera
,
Pluralsight
, and
edX
.
Khan Academy
,
Codeacademy
, and
Datacamp
are also excellent free resources that are widely available. Since applicants come from a variety of academic, personal, and professional backgrounds, we’ve compiled a list of preparatory courses/resources that can be exceptionally helpful to those applying or looking for remediation.
