About Me
My work focuses on expanding the world language programs in K-12 education across Indiana as well as internationalizing P-16 education. My research interests include language teacher cognition, language teacher identity, reflective practices of teacher educators, as well as instructional practices and professional development of language teachers in foreign/second language contexts and dual language immersion programs.
