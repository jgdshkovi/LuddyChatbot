Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loans
A government loan option for graduate and professional students
If you’re a graduate or professional student working toward a degree at IU Bloomington, you can apply for a Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan. You don’t have to show financial need, but you must fill out your
FAFSA
each year and meet the eligibility requirements:
You must be enrolled at least half time (four credit hours).
You must not have a bad credit history, or you must have an approved endorser (someone with a good credit history who agrees to repay the loan if you can’t).
You must be a U.S. citizen or national, a U.S. permanent resident, or an
eligible noncitizen
.

What your loan pays for
If you meet all requirements, you can borrow up to your
estimated cost of attendance
, minus any other financial aid you receive. Your loan will pay for your tuition, fees, room and board, and other eligible school charges. Any funds that remain after these items are paid will be
refunded to you
.

Repaying your loan
While interest charges begin to accrue as soon as you receive your loan, you don’t have to start repaying a Federal Direct Graduate PLUS Loan until up to six months after you graduate or drop below half-time status. You’ll be asked to complete
exit counseling
, which will provide you with information on repaying your loan. We’ll send you email to notify you when it’s time for you to go through exit counseling.
