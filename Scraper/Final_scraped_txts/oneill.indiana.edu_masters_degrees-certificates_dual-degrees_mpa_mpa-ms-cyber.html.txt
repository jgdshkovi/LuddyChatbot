MPA-MS in Cybersecurity Risk Management
MPA-MS in Cybersecurity Risk Management
Combine your MPA with a Master of Science in Cybersecurity Risk Management to promote national security
Knowledge of cybersecurity risk management is increasingly essential to policymakers and leaders across an array of industries, sectors, and nations. Cyber attackers target vulnerable networks and are frequently successful in breaching critical infrastructure, stealing funds and valuable intellectual property. Managing these risks is vital to safeguarding crucial services, ensuring economic competitiveness, and ultimately promoting national security.
To pursue the MPA-MS in Cybersecurity Risk Management degree, you must apply for both the MPA program and the MS in Cybersecurity program separately.
