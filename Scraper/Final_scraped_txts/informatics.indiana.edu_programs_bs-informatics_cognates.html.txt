Cognates
Cognates
Focus your studies with a cognate
As you work toward your bachelor’s degree, you’ll choose a cognate—an area of interest to apply your informatics skills and knowledge. By combining problem-solving and critical-thinking skills with the knowledge of how to develop new tech tools in your cognate area, you’ll give yourself an edge in the job market.
Cognates can be in any field of study offered at IU–if a cognate plan is not already created for your area of interest, you may work with an advisor to develop your own "Individualized Cognate."
Some of your courses may fulfill requirements toward a minor in another field or your general education requirements.
You may choose your cognate in your first semester, you may select an established cognate later in your academic year.
