What Can You Do With So Many Books?
The
HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC)
enables large-scale analysis of works in the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) to facilitate non-profit research and educational uses of the collection. HTRC, which is co-located at Indiana University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, engages in research and development for text analysis of massive digital libraries.
The Center creates and maintains a suite of tools and services for text-based, data-driven research and engages in cutting-edge research on large-scale data analysis. HTRC makes available the collection for text and data mining purposes, while remaining clearly within the bounds of the fair use rights courts have recognized as applying to text analysis.
Relationship to HathiTrust
HathiTrust is a partnership of academic and research institutions, offering a collection of millions of titles digitized from libraries around the world.
Individual access and preservation are important concerns for HathiTrust. It allows users to search for and build collections of digitized works, and to read those in the public domain.
The Research Center’s focus is on the aggregate strengths: what can we learn from so many books? Digitization has enabled large-scale questions that we couldn’t ask before, and the Research Center is here to help you ask them while working within the restrictions of intellectual property law.
