The Two Georges: Parallel Lives In an Age of Revolution
$ 24.95
This is the first book to simultaneously explore in depth the lives and contributions of two globally significant figures of the late eighteenth century: George III (1738–1820), king of Great Britain, and George Washington (1732–1799), first president of the United States.
In considering these men,
The Two Georges
contextualizes, compares, and contrasts their experiences in youth, as family men, as men of the Enlightenment, as adversaries in war, as king and president, and as figures of national myth and memory. Short essays from scholars open each chapter and examine the commonalities and differences between the two Georges as well as the forces and circumstances that informed their lives and leadership. Complementing these essays are features on specific areas of overlap and contrast, such as their military backgrounds, food preferences, and love of science, agriculture, and books; short biographies of their parents, wives, and extended families; and a variety of historic documents, maps, prints, and artwork in the Library of Congress’s collections and from around the world. These supplemental pieces underscore the myriad changes the two Georges participated in and witnessed during an age of revolution.
Serving as the official companion publication to the Library of Congress exhibit, the book reexamines the life of George Washington and paints a fuller picture of King George III. Written by Susan Reyburn and Zach Klitzman.

'I Cannot Live Without Books' Pillow
$ 40.00
The quotation embroidered on this pillow was expressed in a letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams. Many contemporary bibliophiles can identify with his sentiment. If you're one - or know one - this classic pillow makes a perfect gift.  Twisted cord detail. Removable navy cover is poly/cotton. USA made. 12"l. x 14"w.
#21305033
The original letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Adams is in the Library's collections. Jefferson's letter in its entirety reads:
[June 10, 1815]
I have met with, and very kindly and opportunely offered me the means of reprocuring some part of the library treasures which I have ceded to Congress to replace the devastations of British Vandalism at Washington. I cannot live without books, but fewer will suffice where amusement, and not use, is the only future object. I am about sending him a catalogue to which less than his critical knolege of books would hardly be adequate.
Present my high respects to mrs Adams and accept yourself the assurances of my affectionate attachment. Th. Jefferson
