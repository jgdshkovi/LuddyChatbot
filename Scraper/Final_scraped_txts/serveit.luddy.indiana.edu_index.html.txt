Serve IT seeks to apply the technology skills of undergraduate students to build capacity in the local nonprofit community to better serve their own missions.Serve IT offers students the opportunity to use credit hours to put the skills they are learning in school into action with real clients from the local nonprofit community. Students can return numerous semesters, building a portfolio and developing skills such as professional communications, client, project, and team management—all very difficult to teach in a traditional classroom.
