Sending Your TOEFL iBT Scores
Choosing score recipients before the test
Your test fee includes up to four free official TOEFL score reports to be sent to the institutions, agencies or other recipients that you select before you take the test. You can add or delete recipients through your ETS account until 10 p.m. (local test center time) on the day before your test.
If you choose any institution or agency to receive your scores, you won't be able to request a score review of your Writing and/or Speaking sections.

Score delivery time varies based on how your designated score recipients receive scores (all times approximate):
