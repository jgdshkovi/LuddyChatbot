Graduate certificate in cybersecurity law and policy
Society requires individuals with cybersecurity law and policy background to establish the proper legal frameworks for responding to the ways that technology is disrupting existing norms and creating new challenges.
Although cybersecurity issues are often thought of as primarily technical, law and policy are critically important skills in this arena. Cybersecurity law and policy are only beginning to develop and the demand for cybersecurity professionals continues to increase in the private and public sectors at the local, national, and international levels. A few examples illustrate the breadth and need for individuals with a law and policy background in cybersecurity. Consumer risks are created by the Internet of Things. Safety risks are created by self-driving vehicles. Democratic risks are created by various threats to elections. National security risks are created by threats to technology tied to critical infrastructure.
To address these risks, society requires not only individuals with technological expertise, but also individuals with cybersecurity law and policy background to help establish the proper legal frameworks for responding to the ways that technology is disrupting existing norms and creating new challenges. There is a growing need for individuals with formal background in cybersecurity law and policy to both understand the current regulations and to thoughtfully develop new cybersecurity law and policy frameworks in this ever-shifting field.
