Nestled in the rolling hills of southern Indiana, IU Bloomington showcases the kind of landscape you’d expect from the quintessential college campus. You’ll travel through time as you walk the grounds, with the Victorian-era buildings of the Old Crescent giving way to Romanesque, Gothic, Collegiate Gothic, Art Deco, Modern, and postmodern architectural styles of the last 200 years. From its original 10 acres south of downtown, IU Bloomington has grown to nearly 2,000 acres in the northeast quadrant of the city.
Stroll through such memorable landmarks as Dunn’s Woods and the Fine Arts Plaza. Enjoy a picnic on the bank of the Campus River. Experience a moment of Zen in the Commemorative Garden at the Indiana Memorial Union. Whatever you seek, find it at IU Bloomington.
