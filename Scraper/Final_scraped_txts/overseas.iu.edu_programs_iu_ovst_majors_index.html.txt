The experience of taking coursework in your field of study while abroad is invaluable. Whether the course is in art history, environmental studies, or political science, students can discover entirely new perspectives on their disclipline. The programs identified in these lists offer coursework relevant to the corresponding IU major or department. Students must visit the individual course equivalency list to see specific courses offered on the program, and if any of them are pre-approved to count toward a specific IU course requirement. (For example, the course "Evolution and Behavior" on the Wollongong, Australia program has been pre-approved to count as BIOL-L 318.)
If you do not find your major or department in this list, please
