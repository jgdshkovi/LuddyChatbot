Students pursuing a program managed through IU Education Abroad will earn direct IU-Bloomington credit. The search tool below indicates the credit students will earn. This list is not a guarantee of course availability; it is a running list of what previous students may have taken. Consult program-specific webflyers for information about up-to-date course offerings.
The programs listed below are for Education Abroad-managed programs, including “shared” programs open to Kelley School of Business majors and non-Kelley majors.
The
Kelley School of Business International Programs
office maintains course equivalencies for Business major credit; email
ksabroad@iu.edu
for more information.
Students seeking information about programs run through other IU units or campuses should consult the
IU Unit-Based program list
.
Students can automatically fulfill the Global Civilizations and Culture (GCC) requirement on a semester-length, IU-approved program. Students can fulfill the World Languages and Cultures (WLC) requirement on a program abroad that is at least 6 weeks long and yields at least 6 credits (College of Arts and Sciences Bachelor of Arts majors must complete four semesters of a foreign language, which already fulfills the WLC requirement). Neither GCC nor WLC tags are noted in the course equivalencies below.
Courses that carry CASE or general education tags are subject to change yearly, and students are responsible for ensuring they consult the appropriate
CASE
or
IUB general education
lists, as well as the Education Abroad list below.
